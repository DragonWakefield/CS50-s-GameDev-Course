This is my 3-D Collector/Survival Game "Apocalypse Tp: The Reckoning of the Toiletpaperless" made with Unity

The Objective of this game is to run around the warehouse collecting toiletpaper (because there was a lack of supplies due to
corona panic buying) while avoiding the zombies trying to steal your toilet paper. The objective of this game is too collect
the goal amount of toilet paper for each round without dying to the zombies (death is acheived by losing all your toiletpaper)


This game was entirely handmade by myself and features a randomly spawning shelf maze/obstacles, zombies that speed up based on how much total toiletpaper you collect, and a 3-D animated Plague Doctor. 

There are multiple states to separate the User's experience: 
    - The Start State: has a start button to go to the play state, a menu button for the menu state, and an exit button to      exit the application

    - The Play State:the actual playable game state

    - The Menu State: Has volume controls, control descriptions, and game details and a back button to return to the start state

    - The Game Over State: has a restart button to reset the game (score and level) and a main menu button

    - The Progression State: has a continue button to continue the game (saving the total score and level) and a main menu button

A lot of the complexity in this game lies in the 3-D animations and player controls, the Zombie Animations and Path-finding, the placement of the Shelf-walls in that two shelves of the same type shouldn't overlap with each other, and the setting of win/lose conditions.

I believe that this game meets the complexity and distinctiveness required as the closest game to mine in this course would be the Dreadhalls game, but Apocalypse Tp involves a third-person camera (not done in the course), 3-D platforming in the form of jumping from shelf to shelf, and Enemies that spawn and attack the player if they are within proximity or if the player makes too much noise by running. Also, with regards to Dreadhalls where the walls are procedurally generated, my walls are randomly placed but take into acount the other walls of the same type around it making for a more random platforming/maze experience. I also have included more UI elements in my game like a slider that controls the game's music and sound volume, a chart of controls, varies buttons that transfer from state to state. There are also different animations based on the player's sucess or death. I also implemented a highscore system that keeps track of the player's lifetime highscore,as well as a separate tracker to save the player's total number of toilet paper collected since they started playing. 

Because of these reasons, I believe that my game "Apocalypse TP:The Rereckoning of the Toiletpaperless" is distinct enough from all the other games assigned in this course and demonstrates the complexity require for this assignment.
